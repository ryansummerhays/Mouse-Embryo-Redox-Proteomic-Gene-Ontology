# Mouse-Embryo-Redox-Proteomic-Gene-Ontology

Contains Gene Ontology Analysis from Mouse Embryo Redox Proteomic data (Gestational Days 8-9).\
UniProt IDs represent the proteins that undergo the greatest redox changes during unmanipulated development (calculated via ANOVA).

**HOW TO REPLICATE THE GENE ONTOLOGY**\
PANTHER Gene Ontology web viewer: https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo

- "Term Enrichment Service"

- Open "UniProt Significant Redox IDs" csv file
  - Copy/Paste IDs in "Your genes here..."

- "Mus Musculus"

- After the PANTHER viewer is open, change "Annotation Data Set" to various options
  - "GO biological process complete", "PANTHER GO-slim biological process", "PANTHER pathways", "Reactome pathways"
